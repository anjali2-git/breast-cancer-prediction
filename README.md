# breast-cancer-prediction
Machine learning project to predict breast cancer malignancy using the Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training (Random Forest, SVM), and performance evaluation.”
# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## 🔍 Objectives
- Load and clean medical dataset
- Apply EDA and visualizations
- Train models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Model Performance
Achieved 97% accuracy with Random Forest on the test set.

## 🚀 Try it Yourself
Clone the repo and run `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter.
